      Set up a correlation between the start date, due date, done ratio and status of issues.

      * If done ratio is changed to 100% and status is "In Process", status changes to "Resolved"
      * If status is "New", "Resolved" or "Feedback" and done ratio is changed to value less than 100%, status changes
to "In process"
      * If status is changed to "In process" and start date is not set, then it sets to current date
      * If status is changed to "Resolved" and end date is not set, then it set to due date

      To use this script properly, turn off "Use current date as start date for new issues" option in the settings as
this script already do it own way.
